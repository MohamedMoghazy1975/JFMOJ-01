# Flask: Read from a Database

This section of the resource **Python Beginners** deals with Flask (see [Flask Intro](https://python-adv-web-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flask.html)) and using Flask with a database (see [Flask and Databases](https://python-adv-web-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flask_db1.html)).

The code in this folder, */flask/databases/flask_db_read/,* applies to one specific SQLite database, which is wholly contained in the file named *sockmarket.db.*

The main app file is *read_db.py.* Before trying to run it, you'll need to install the libraries and extensions (see *requirements.txt*).

The database and most of the code in the folder is explained in [Flask: Read from a Database](https://python-adv-web-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flask_db2.html).

The templates and most of the code will be the same for a different relational database system such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. The difference is in how you need to connect to the database if it is a different kind. How to connect to a MySQL/MariaDB database is covered in [Flask and Databases](https://python-adv-web-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flask_db1.html).

The rest of the code is the same once you have edited the Python code (in *read_db.py*) to connect successfully to your database.
