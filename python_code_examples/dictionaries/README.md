# About these files

These Python scripts are based on [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) (second edition), chapter 5. All of the code is explained in that chapter.

It is recommended that you **run the files** in the Terminal. Run them multiple times until you understand exactly what each line in the code does.

**Script:** *simple_dict.py*

Run this and also examine the code to get a feel for dictionary structure and how to change the contents of a dictionary.

**Script:** *looping_keys_values.py*

Learn how to loop over and view keys alone, values, alone, or keys and values together &mdash; for reading what is in a dictionary.

**Module** *list_of_dicts.py*

A list of dictionaries, as an example.

**Script:** *complex_dicts.py*

Run this and also examine the code to understand complex dictionaries &mdash; which contain embedded dictionaries within other dictionaries.

**Script:** *dictreader_example.py* **CSV file** *sample.csv*

Using Pythonâ€™s `csv` module, this script opens a CSV file and creates a reader object of dictionaries from it, using `csv.DictReader()`.

**Script:** *dictreader_example2.py* **CSV file** *sample.csv*

Similar to the previous script, this one copies each dictionary from the reader object into a list.
