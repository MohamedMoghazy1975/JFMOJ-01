# About these folders

1. *learn_python* contains very basic files demonstrating if-elif-else (conditional statements), while-loops, for-loops, `random.randint()`, and the basic Python built-in functions `print()`, `input()`, `len()`, `int()` and `str()`.

2. *functions* contains examples of basic functions to demonstrate use of parameters and arguments, return statements, local and global scope, and exception handling (`try` / `except`).

3. *loops_and_lists* contains examples of for-loops using Python lists, list methods such as `append()`, `remove()` and `sort()`, and tuples (similar to lists, but immutable).

4. *working_with_files* covers the `pathlib` module and how to open, read, write to, and close plain-text files with Python.
