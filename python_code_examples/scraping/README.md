# About these files

These Python scripts and files are examples of web scraping.

It is recommended that you **run the files** in the Terminal.

**Script:** *first_bs_test.py*

This beginner scraping script uses BeautifulSoup. It is explained line by line in [Web Scraping Intro](https://python-adv-web-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scraping.html).

**Jupyter Notebook:** *soup_practice.ipynb*

This notebook demonstrates a trial-and-error process of examining a website, step by step, to figure out what scraping code will work. You can open it for viewing only here in GitHub without running the file. To run the file, youâ€™ll need BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Jupyter Notebook.

**Script:** *box_office_scraper.py*

This Python script takes the final code from the notebook *soup_practice.ipynb* and gives the final result. It includes *commented* code for writing to a CSV file.

**Text file:** *movies.csv*

This CSV file is generated by both the notebook *soup_practice.ipynb* and the script *box_office_scraper.py*.
