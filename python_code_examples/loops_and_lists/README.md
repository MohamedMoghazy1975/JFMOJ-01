# About these files

These Python scripts are based on [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) (second edition), chapter 4. All of the code is explained that chapter.

It is recommended that you **run the files** in the Terminal. Run them multiple times until you understand exactly what each line in the code does.
