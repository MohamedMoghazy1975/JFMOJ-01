Configuring the Theme
https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring.html

Viewing the docs you create
---------------------------
Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so --
    make builder
-- where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

Themes
------
Looked at a bunch of themes
https://sphinx-themes.org/

Picked this one
https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Liked one other theme but it had NPM/Node crap, so no.
